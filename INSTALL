Prerequisites
=============

Rhythmbox requires the following packages:

- A working GNOME platform including glib 2.66, gtk+ 3.16, and libsoup 3
- meson 0.59 or newer
- totem-plparser 3.2.0 or newer
- GStreamer 1.4.0. or newer and associated plugin packages
- libpeas 0.7.3 or newer
- json-glib
- libxml2 2.7.8 or newer
- tdb 1.2.6 or newer
- gettext 0.20 or newer

Rhythmbox can also make use of the following packages:

- pygobject 3.0.0 or newer (for python plugin support)
- GUdev 143 or newer (for iPod and generic audio player support)
- libgpod 0.7.92 or newer (for iPod support)
- libnotify 0.7 or newer
- libbrasero-media 2.31.5 or newer
- libdmapsharing 3.9.11 or newer
- libmtp 0.3.0 or newer
- libsecret 0.18 or newer
- grilo 0.3.1 or newer
- itstool (for documentation)
- gtk-doc (for development documentation)

Many package managers provide a way to install all the build dependencies for
a package, such as 'dnf builddep' or 'apt-get build-dep', which will install
almost all of the above.  The requirements may have changed slightly between
the version packaged in the distribution and the current development version,
so you might have to install some additional packages.


Simple install procedure
========================

  % meson _build -Dprefix=$PWD/_install          # prepare the build
  % ninja -C _build                              # build Rhythmbox
  % ninja -C _build install                      # install Rhythmbox

This installs Rhythmbox to the _install directory under the source tree.
The executable to run will then be _install/bin/rhythmbox.
Before you can run it from there, you will also need to set an environment
variable to load schemas from the install location:

  % export GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR=$PWD/_install/share/glib-2.0/schemas
  % _install/bin/rhythmbox

By default, the build will enable optional features if the packages they require
are installed.  To check which options are available and which are enabled,
run 'meson configure _build'.
