/**
 * SECTION:rb-shell-player
 * @short_description: playback state management
 *
 * The shell player (or player shell, depending on who you're talking to)
 * manages the #RBPlayer instance, tracks the current playing #RhythmDBEntry,
 * and manages the various #RBPlayOrder instances.  It provides simple operations
 * such as next, previous, play/pause, and seek.
 *
 * When playing internet radio streams, it first attempts to read the stream URL
 * as a playlist.  If this succeeds, the URLs from the playlist are stored in a
 * list and tried in turn in case of errors.  If the playlist parsing fails, the
 * stream URL is played directly.
 *
 * The mapping from the separate shuffle and repeat settings to an #RBPlayOrder
 * instance occurs in here.  The play order logic can also support a number of
 * additional play orders not accessible via the shuffle and repeat buttons.
 *
 * If the player backend supports multiple streams, the shell player crossfades
 * between streams by watching the elapsed time of the current stream and simulating
 * an end-of-stream event when it gets within the crossfade duration of the actual
 * end.
