How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product rhythmbox.) You will need to create an
account for yourself.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - GStreamer version (or Xine version if you're using the Xine backend)
   - Available GStreamer plugins (run gst-inspect with no arguments)
   
  And anything else you think is relevant.

* Before you report a bug, it will be useful to know if GStreamer works.
  Try running this command:

  $ gst-launch gnomevfssrc location=/path/to/my/musicfile.ogg ! spider ! volume ! $(gconftool-2 -g /system/gstreamer/default/audiosink)  

  Just replace /path/to/my/musicfile.ogg with some sound file.
  You might also want to try the monkey-media tests/test-cmdline program.

* How to reproduce the bug.

  If you can reproduce the bug with one of the programs in tests/, that
  will be most convenient.  Otherwise, please include a short test program
  that exhibits the behavior.  As a last resort, you can also provide
  a pointer to a larger piece of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occured, and a trace (which can be obtained by using gdb or bug-buddy).
