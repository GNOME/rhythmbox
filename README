How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product rhythmbox.) You will need to create an
account for yourself.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - GStreamer version
   - Available GStreamer plugins (run gst-inspect with no arguments)
   
  And anything else you think is relevant.

* If rhythmbox crashes when you try to import a folder full of music files
  to your library, you can pinpoint the exact file causing the crash
  by running "rhythmbox -d" from a console. It will output lots of debugging
  information, the last file mentioned in the console output will quite likely
  correspond to the file causing the crash. If you want to save the debug log
  to a file, use "rhythmbox -d 2> debug.log".

* Before you report a bug, it will be useful to know if GStreamer works.
  If you have playback issues, try running this command:

  $ gst-launch-0.10 playbin2 uri="file:///path/to/my/musicfile.ogg"

  If you have troubles importing a specific file to your library, try running:

  $ gst-launch-0.10 -t uridecodebin uri=file:///path/to/my/musicfile.ogg  ! fakesink
 
  Just replace /path/to/my/musicfile.ogg with some sound file in the 2 commands
  above.

* How to reproduce the bug.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occured, and a trace (which can be obtained by using gdb or bug-buddy).
  See https://wiki.gnome.org/Community/GettingInTouch/Bugzilla/GettingTraces
  for more information on getting stack traces.
